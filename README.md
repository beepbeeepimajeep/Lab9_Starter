### AI-Assisted Planning & Debugging Notes

ChatGPT was used strategically to assist in both planning and debugging:

- **Task Planning:** The lab prompt was broken into discrete, actionable tasks with ChatGPT's help, forming the foundation for our TODO list and early implementation efforts.
- **Learning Support:** ChatGPT helped explain key JavaScript concepts like the `preventDefault()` method, enabling correct event handling behavior in forms.
- **Boilerplate Generation:** We used ChatGPT to produce minimal, well-commented JavaScript boilerplate code to start the project with a clear, lean foundation.
- **Debugging Support:** When integrating TrackJS for error monitoring, ChatGPT assisted in identifying and resolving setup issues, ensuring successful tracking and error logging.
